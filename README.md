Ghost in the Machine: Live Fire Threat Actor Dissection

Go beyond static artifacts and canned simulations. This workshop introduces a next-level threat actor emulation, immersing you in a live fire dissection experience against implants inspired by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) TTPs. 

You'll execute these multi-stage implants within your analysis VM and watch them interact live with our custom, controlled C2 infrastructure â€“ a rarity in typical analysis. Decrypt actual network traffic, reverse dynamically delivered payloads, and unravel the entire kill chain as it happens. Prepare for a hands-on CTF challenge analyzing a uniquely realistic, sophisticated, and interactive threat.
